The COVID-19 data analysis project aims to utilize SQL to comprehensively explore and analyze a dataset consisting of 78,386 rows and 8 columns, including country, province, latitude, longitude, date, confirmed, deaths, and recovered cases. The project involves importing this data into a MySQL database, which is launched in MySQL Workbench and accessed from a notebook environment. By performing various data manipulation and querying tasks, the analysis seeks to uncover key insights such as tracking the spread of the virus over time, identifying trends in infection rates, evaluating the effectiveness of public health interventions, and comparing impacts across different regions.
